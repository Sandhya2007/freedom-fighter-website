   <p><i>Chandrashekhar Azad was a great Indian freedom fighter. His fierce patriotism and courage inspired others of his generation to enter freedom struggle.
     He was the mentor of Bhagat Singh, another great freedom fighter, and along with Bhagat Singh he is considered as one of the greatest revolutionaries that India has produced.
     Chandrashekhar Azad was a Bharatiya revolutionary from Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh.
    He believed that his Dharma was to fight for the Nation. He said a soldier never relinquishes his weapon.
     <b>He was involved in the Kakori Train Robbery (1926), in the attempt to blow up the Viceroy’s train (1926),</b> and in the shooting of Saunders at Lahore (1928) to avenge the killing of Lala Lajpat Rai.
    He formed the <b>‘Hindustan Socialist Republican Association’</b>.  He was an ideal for revolutionaries such as Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Batukeshwar Dutt and Rajguru.
    <h2>Chandrashekhar Azad enters in freedom struggle</h2>
    Chandrashekhar Azad was born on July 23,1906 in Badarka village of Unnao district in Uttar Pradesh.
     His parents were Pandit Sitaram Tiwari and Jagarani Devi. Pandit Sitaram Tiwari was serving in erstwhile estate of Alirajpur (situated in present day Madhya Pradesh) and Chandrashekhar Azad’s
      childhood was spent in the village Bhabra. On the insistence of his mother Jagrani Devi, Chandrashekhar Azad went to Kashi Vidyapeeth, Benaras for studying Sanskrit.
    Chandrashekhar Azad was deeply troubled by the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre in Amritsar in 1919. In 1921, when Mahatma Gandhi launched Non-Cooperation movement, he actively participated in revolutionary activities.
     He received his first punishment at the age of fifteen. He was caught while indulging in revolutionary activities. When the magistrate asked him his name, he said “Azad” (meaning free). He was sentenced to fifteen lashes.
      With each stroke of the whip the young Chandrasekhar shouted “Bharat Mata ki Jai !”. From then on Chandrashekhar assumed the title of Azad and came to known as Chandrashekhar Azad. He vowed that he would never be arrested by the British police and would die as free man.
    <h2>Chandrashekhar Azad as a revolutionary</h2>
    Chandrashekhar Azad was then attracted towards more aggressive and revolutionary ideals.
     He committed himself to complete independence by any means. Azad and his compatriots would target British officials known for their oppressive actions against ordinary people and freedom fighters.
    Azad was a terror for British police. He was on their hit list and the British police badly wanted to capture him dead or alive. On February 27, 1931 Azad met two of his comrades at the Alfred Park Allahabad. He was betrayed by an informer who had informed the British police. The police surrounded the park and ordered Azad to surrender. Azad fought alone valiantly and killed three policemen. But finding himself surrounded and seeing no route for escape, he shot himself. Thus he kept his pledge of not being caught alive.
    Azad lived only for 25 years, but inspired thousands of Indians to take part in freedom struggle.</i></p>

     <h2 style="color:#333"> Alluri Sitarama Raju</h2>

<div><p><i>A folk hero in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Alluri Sitarama Raju is little-known outside the Telugu-speaking belt.
 Raju mobilised the Adivasis in the Rampa region, north of the Godavari, and waged a guerrilla war against the British from 1922 to 1924.
  After the British failed to crush the rebellion, Thomas George Rutherford was called in April 1924. He crushed the rebellion and Raju was captured and killed on May 7, 1924.
  As a freedom fighter, Surya Sen took part in India’s struggle for independence. He was the president of the Chittagong (in present-day Bangladesh) branch of the Indian National Congress and participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement.
   However, he is most widely known for the 1930 raids on the British armouries in Chittagong in 1930. 
   The attack was met with brutal repression, which led to Sen’s hanging in January 1934.
  <h2> Growth as leader</h2>
   Indicative of his future as a leader, Rama Raju in his high school days was often found riding his uncle horses to distant hilly places and familiarise himself with various problems that were being faced by the different tribal people who were then living under the British colonial rule. He was particularly moved by seeing the hardships of the Koyas, a people of hill tribe. Fond of pilgrimage, in 1921 he visited Gangotri and Nashik, birthplaces of the holy rivers Ganga and Godavari. During his travels in the country, he met various revolutionaries in Chittagong. On seeing the socio-economic conditions of the Indian people, particularly those of the tribals, he was severely appalled and decided to build a movement for their emancipation from the British rule. He then settled down in the Papi hills near Godavari District, an area with a high density of tribal people.[14][15][16]
   
   Sitarama Raju initially became a Sadhu and practiced various spiritual disciplines to gain moral stature and spiritual powers. He also became an expert healer with herbs.[17] During this time, the efforts of Christian missionaries to gain converts by any means amongst the hill tribes particularly annoyed him as he saw conversion as a tool to perpetuate imperialism. He continued living an austere life with bare minimum needs among the tribal people. Taking only food items like fruits and honey from them, he would return much of everything that was offered to him back to the tribals with his blessings. Very soon his charismatic nature gained him a reputation among the tribals of being someone possessed with holy powers, even a messianic status--a reputation that was bolstered both by myths he created about himself and by his acceptance of ones about him that were established by others, including those concerning his invincibility.[18][10]
   
   The people of the hill-tribes were an innocent but militant people who were made to pay a lot of dues for activities like grazing cattle, collecting fruit, fuel, and trading with outsiders. They were prevented from practicing their ‘Podu’ or ‘Jungle’ cultivation and their very traditional way of life was threatened. Rama Raju after seeing their exploitation, pleaded with the officials for mercy but it was all in vain. He then felt that the only way out is through rebellion.[17]
   
   Noting the grievances of the tribals and finding solutions to their problems, he then started to organise and educate them about their rights and prepared them for a fight against the oppression and tyranny of the forest and revenue officials, missionaries, and the police. Touring the forest terrains he gained an extensive knowledge of the geographical features, which later helped him in his future as a guerrilla warfare tactician. Around this time when the British authorities confiscated their ancestral properties, the Koya tribal brothers, Gam Malludora and Gam Gantamdora who were both freedom fighters joined the ranks of Rama Raju and became his lieutenants. As the oppressive practices of the British continued to become unbearable and rebellion became the last option for people to live free, Rama Raju became their natural leader. The Government then did try to win him over by offering 60 acres of fertile land for his ashram, but he rejected it and stood by the people.[19][15]
  <h2> Actions</h2>
   With his supporters, Rama Raju built strong and powerful troops of fighters.[15] With the help of Rallapalli Kasannla, a non-cooperator and a Khadi producer from Tuni, Rama Raju, who had been reported to be a regular Khadi wearer provided only Khadi uniforms to all his troops.[1] Sporting traditional weaponry like bow-and-arrow and spears, employing tactics like using whistles and beating drums to exchange messages amongst themselves, the revolutionaries managed to achieve spectacular success initially in their fight against the British. Realising that traditional weaponry would not be of much use against the British, who were all well equipped with modern firearms, Raju thought the best way forward is to take them away from the enemy and started launching attacks on their police stations.[1</i></p>

 <p><i> While the likes of Mangal Pandey, Rani Lakshmibai, Nana Saheb and Tantia Tope, among a few others, are widely remembered for their role in the revolt of 1857, many have remained unknown.
   One such freedom fighter is Peer Ali Khan. A bookseller by profession, Khan played a role in the revolt in Patna.
  Expectedly, the British retaliated brutally, and Khan was captured and given capital punishment for participating in the rebellion.
  Peer Ali Khan was a composed freedom fighter who worked clandestinely. He is said to have been born in about 1812. His nature of work was secretive, hence there is no common ground as to his birthplace. According to the report of William Taylor, an official of the East India Company who held charge as the Commissioner of Patna Division from 1855 to 1857, "Peer Ali was a native of Lucknow, but had resided for many years at Patna; he was by trade, a Book-seller, and I strongly suspect that he may have originally established himself here, for the express purpose of carrying on the intrigues which issued in this abortive out-break".

  Peer Ali was a bookseller, who played a leading role in the organization of the Great Revolt of 1857 in the Patna district in July 1857. He was captured by the British after the defeat of the rebel forces. Khan was given capital punishment for participating in the freedom struggle of 1857, along with other rebels.
  
  A road adjacent to the Patna Airport is named after him. Also, Shaheed Peer Ali Khan Park, a children's park in front of the District Magistrate's residence near the Gandhi Maidan in Patna, was named after him by the State Government of Bihar.</i></p>

  <h2 style="color: crimson;">Bhikaji Cama</h2>

 While many public places are named after her, the contribution of Bhikaji Cama to India’s freedom is less talked about.
     It is said that she was drawn to the cause after she met Dadabhai Naoroji in London. 
     Thereafter, she met other nationalists too, such as Lala Hardayal and Shyamji Varma.
    She became an active member of the movement and went on to publish booklets for Indians living in England to steer them towards independence.
    <h2>Role in the Freedom Struggle</h2>
During her visit to London, Bhikaiji Cama met Shyamji Krishna Varma, Indian nationalist known for his speeches he gave in Hyde Park. She met Dadabhai Naoroji. The president of the British committee of the Indian National Congress (founded on December 28, 1885). 

Bhikaiji Cama moved to Paris where she founded the Paris Indian Society. Munchershah Burjorji Godrej and S.R. Rana were the co-founders of this society. Joining hands with the Indian diaspora fighting for independence while in exile, she wrote and distributed literature for the freedom movement. One of the works she distributed included copies of the Bande Mataram which was banned by the British government in India. The literature she created found its way to India via the French colony at Pondicherry.

Bhikaiji Cama spoke at length about the devastating effects of British Colonialism at Stuttgart, Germany in 1907. These effects included constant famine and crippling taxes that had ripped the Indian economy to shreds. It was during this event when she unfurled the “Flag of Independence”. The flag was designed by Bhikaiji Cama and fellow activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. The flag of independence would be the precursor to the current national flag of India.

Following the assassination of William Hutt Curzon Wyllie in 1909, the authorities in London began cracking down on Indian nationalists living there. Bhikaji Cama was in Paris at the time and the British request her to be extradited by the French but they refused. Vladimir Lenin reportedly invited her to reside in the Soviet Union years later, but she declined.

The situation began to take a complicated turn when France and Britain became allies upon the outbreak of World War I. The French, seeking to prevent anything that might spoil this new alliance, restricted the activities of the India freedom fighters. Many left France, while Bhikaiji Cama stayed on. She was arrested along with Rewabhai Rana while trying to incite Indian troops at Bordeaux on their way to the front. Rana was exiled to the Caribbean while Bikhaiji Cama was sent to Southern France in 1915. On account of her failing health, she was allowed to return to her residence at Bordeaux provided she reported on a weekly basis to the local police station.
