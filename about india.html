            <p> <i>British raj, period of direct British rule over the Indian subcontinent from 1858 until the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947.
                The raj succeeded management of the subcontinent by the British East India Company, after general distrust and dissatisfaction with company leadership resulted in a widespread mutiny of sepoy troops in 1857,
             causing the British to reconsider the structure of governance in India. The British government took possession of the company’s assets and imposed direct rule.
             The raj was intended to increase Indian participation in governance, but the powerlessness of Indians to determine their own future without the consent of the British led to an increasingly adamant national independence movement.</i>
            </p>
            <p><i><h2>Background</h2>
                Though trade with India had been highly valued by Europeans since ancient times, the long route between them was subject to many potential obstacles and obfuscations from middlemen, making trade unsafe, unreliable, and expensive.
                 This was especially true after the collapse of the Mongol empire and the rise of the Ottoman Empire all but blocked the ancient Silk Road. As Europeans, led by the Portuguese, began to explore maritime navigation routes to bypass middlemen,
                  the distance of the venture required merchants to set up fortified posts.</i></p>
                  <p><i><h2>Establishment of direct British governance
                    Government of India Act of 1858</h2>
                    Much of the blame for the mutiny fell on the ineptitude of the East India Company. On August 2, 1858, Parliament passed the Government of India Act, transferring British power over India from the company to the crown.
                    The merchant company’s residual powers were vested in the secretary of state for India, a minister of Great Britain’s cabinet,
                    who would preside over the India Office in London and be assisted and advised, especially in financial matters, by a Council of India, which consisted initially of 15 Britons, 7 of whom were elected from among the old company’s
                    court of directors and 8 of whom were appointed by the crown. Though some of Britain’s most powerful political leaders became secretaries of state for India in the latter half of the 19th century, actual control over the government of India remained in the hands of British viceroys—who divided their time between Calcutta (Kolkata)
                     and Simla (Shimla)—and their “steel frame” of approximately 1,500 Indian Civil Service (ICS) officials posted “on the spot” throughout British India.</i></p>

                        In March 1947 Louis Mountbatten arrived in India as its last viceroy of the British Empire. He had instructions to oversee the decolonization of the country—ideally, the devolution of power to an Indian government that would include the whole subcontinent—and wide freedom of action to end the British raj on whatever terms he deemed wisest.
                         Mountbatten soon became convinced that the differences between the Muslim League and the Congress Party were irreconcilable in the near term, that speed was of the essence because of the real risks of mutiny among Indian troops or the outbreak of civil war, and that a partition was the only expedient option for independence. Mountbatten’s
                          plan for the partition of India was announced on June 3, 1947.</i></p>

    <div><p><i><h1>India After Independence -Achievements</h1>
        Immediately after India got independence, Indian citizens had the right to vote to choose the government into power. It is ironic to note that America gave that right to its citizens after 150 years of gaining Independence. 
         One of the pioneers who secured freedom for India from the hands of the British was Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi began this fight for freedom in 1914 using a unique method of non-violence or satyagraha.
        According to Indian history, the first freedom fighter from India was Mangal Pandey. Pandey began the real fight for India’s freedom from the British in 1857. Slowly, the momentum gathered steam in India, and it became a free country in 1947. 
        
       <h2> Significant Developments In India After Independence</h2>
        Some of the most significant developments in India after independence have been discussed below briefly:
        
        The Indian Railways were formed in 1951. India has one of the largest and busiest rail networks in the world. Indian Railways, as it is known, operates in more than 7000 stations.
        The first general election in India was held in 1951 with Congress winning the majority.
        India showed the world that it could be a superpower by developing Asia’s first nuclear reactor. The Apsara nuclear reactor was developed in 1956.
        In one of the most powerful showcases to the world, Chandrayaan 1 was launched in 2008 to the moon.
        Sir M Visvesvaraya, the father of Indian Economic Planning, helped build the Indian economy in its strongest form. 
        <h2>India: A Powerful Nation</h2>
        Yes, India has emerged more vital than ever before. In Asia alone, India stands as one o the most powerful countries. The country witnessed the following events over the years during the last decade:
        
        The passing of the National Food Security Act, 2013, for offering food grains at a low price for two-thirds of the population.
        The Orbiter Mission to Mars happened in 2013. It was launched successfully by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) on November 5.
        WHO (World Health Organization), in March 2014, declared India as Polio free nation in Asia.
        The same year also saw India having its GPS.
        The indigenously developed light combat aircraft Tejas showcased India’s might in the air.
        The First Independence Day of India
        The first Independence Day of India took place in the year 1947. Jawahar Lal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India, unfurled the country’s tri-colour flag. This Independence Day ceremony took place in the Red Fort. 
        
        Since then, every year, the Prime Minister of India hoists the tri-colour flag at Red Fort. India became independent on August 15, 1947. The flag is hoisted at the Lahori Gate in New Delhi. The first Independence Day of India is dedicated to those brave men and women who laid down their lives to free their motherland. 
        
        It was their dream to provide their next generations with a new India that was free from the shackles of the British. However, many men and women died and were tortured in the process. Many children were left orphaned and suffered under the British. But, India rose fearlessly.
        
        Nowadays, during the Independence Day ceremony after the Prime Minister’s address, a military parade is held in the Red Fort. This parade showcases the military might of the country to the world. The President of India also delivers a speech that is broadcast on Television. 
        
        <h2>Separation of Bhutan and Nepal from India</h2>
        As surprising as it may sound, Bhutan and Nepal were parts of India before the Independence. When the Britishers left India in 1947, Bhutan’s association with the East India Company ended. 
        
        The Himalayan Kingdom belonged to India. After two years, a formal agreement was signed between India and Bhutan, declaring them independent countries. After India gained Independence, the Sugauli Treaty was signed. The treaty settled Nepal’s border with India along the Kali River. 
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
        There is no denying that after India gained Independence, her citizens made significant contributions to the economy and technological advancements. Indians are known for their hard work, dedication, and resilience to face any obstacle that comes their way. 
        
        From the above, it is pretty evident that Indians have excelled in almost all fields post-independence. Whether it is science, information technology, sports, or even in the army. Indian men and women have showcased their true worth, which is truly a marvel. </i></p></div>
